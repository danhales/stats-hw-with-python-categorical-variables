    "Obviously, doing _all_ of your homework with Python is a bad idea––the code you write at home will not help you on an exam taken on paper. That said, it's definitely possible to benefit from doing _some_ of your homework with Python. It requires you to analyze the problem from a new perspective, which deepens your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you **should** do is work a few problems out by hand first, so you can get used to the steps needed to solve the problem. Next, you should check your work (odd problems almost always have solutions in the back of the textbook). Then, you should write code that will give you the same answer as you got when you did the problem by hand. Finally, you should generalize that code into a function that will allow you to solve similar problems.\n",
